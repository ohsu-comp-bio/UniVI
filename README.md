UniVI is a workflow that uses a variational mixture of experts autoencoder framework to learn correlations between multimodal biological sequencing data - namely for multimodal single-cell sequencing methods.

We currently have a manuscript in preparation which I will link here when it is online.

We have done several experiments that highlight UniVI's efficacy, including aligning the manifolds of both CITE-seq (scRNA/scADT) data and ATAC-seq (scRNA/scATAC) data.). We have shown that UniVI can be used on a variety of data types without relying on prior information and have interrogated the trained models in depth.
